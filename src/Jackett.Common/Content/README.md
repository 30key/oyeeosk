This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

At the moment, you will likely need to generate a production build (see below) to test the UI with data.

Follow the below steps and then restart the Jackett development server to see changes.

## Generating Production Build

Run the following command to generate static files for Jackett to use.

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```

Code will be linted/formatted upon execution. These files in `out/` are used in Jackett's build process.
